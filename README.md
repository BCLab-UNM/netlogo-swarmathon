# netlogo-swarmathon
This is a series of 4 tutorial modules [Sw1-4] created in NetLogo that prepare the user for participation in the HS Division of the 2017 NASA Swarmathon. One additional module, [Sw5], serves as the base for the participant's competition submission.

<u>KNOWN BUGS AND WORKAROUNDS</u><br>
<ul>
<li>BUG: [all .nlogo files] Double clicking on an .nlogo file to open it sometimes results in the file opening empty.<br>
WORKAROUND: Don't panic! Open the file directly through NetLogo <code>(File -> Open...)</code>. This a NetLogo thing and cannot be resolved from our end.
<li>BUG: [Sw2] This module runs slower than other modules.<br>
WORKAROUND: There's a lot of drawing going on with the multiple pheromone trails. You can speed it up a bit by changing <code>view updates</code> to <code>on ticks</code> on the Interface tab.
<li>BUG: [SW3] When run at high speeds, the robots sometimes get "off track."<br>
WORKAROUND: Decrease the speed slider to be on the <code>slower</code> side.
<li>BUG: Formatting on .pages versions of walkthrough is wonky in some places.
